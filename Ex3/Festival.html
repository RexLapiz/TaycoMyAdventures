    <section id="Intro">
        <p>   Mid year of 2023 before Ferd(our old friend) reached out to us, our group of friend decided to go to Festival Mall to eat and to adventure things there.
          We spent a lot of rescheduling this trip due to busy schedules and sudden urgency of everyone but in the end we still managed to make it happen.
          We arrived there not too long since there wasn't much traffic and we took a bus. It never bores me whenever I go out with my friends, we never run out of conversation to talk to and they're all so funny. That's why I like all of them, we share many similarities and vibes.
          We arrived there exploring major attractions of the place, and checked what's the best food place they have to offer. As we explore the place, we've reached the back of the mall where there was a lake and food vendors. I was astonished with the lights and aesthetics of the place, sadly we haven't taken many photos because our phone batteries are getting low.
          We didn't want to go further and instead of going inside to eat, we stayed there and bought street foods and enjoyed the night. It was a peaceful and wonderful night. We talked about our future plans, how's everyone doing with their lives and we laugh a lot. I really love going out with my friends, now we go out frequently but we just don't take much pictures. 
          Everything is doing great until a heavy rain arrived, I don't know why but last year every trip we had it always rains whenever we're about to go home. So yeah it rained heavily and we got home soaking wet. It was fun and I will do it again whenever. This summer we plan to go to an outing this time, along with our church members.</p>
