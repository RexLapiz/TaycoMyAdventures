    <section id="Intro">
        <p>   Last year Christmas, after our friends got back to us. We've decided to plan on going to a mall sale, since our friend invited us and he said he'd treat us. Normally I don't go out much since I have things to do, but when my friends want me to go and will treat my food I couldn't say no.
            Excitement was as we arrived in our meeting area, we arrived there pretty late due to heavy traffic again but we arrived there having fun.
            The mall greeted us with dazzling neon lights and numerous things to adventure. We have visited numerous clothing shops, I bought a black t-shirt and searched for a place to eat. 
            We decided to eat at a Korean barbeque place, and our friend treated us. To be honest we're not satisfied, and thinks it's way overpriced.
            We had tried different korean barbeque places and sadly this one is the lowest on the rank. 
            We took a lot of pictures altogether and made fun of each other's stolen pictures.
            When we got outside we didn't realized that it was raining, and some of us including me forgot to bring an umbrella.
            we all shared 3 umbrellas and got soaked since it rained heavy, it was very fun but after that we got sick at home.</p>
